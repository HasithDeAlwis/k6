k6 `v1.0.0` is here ðŸŽ‰!

After 9 years, 9k+ commits and 58 releases from the first commit in 2015, we're excited to announce that we're going to leave behind the `v0.x` series. Starting from now k6 aligns with the industry standard of following the semantic versioning scheme and will release this and future versions by following its new stability policy.

This release includes:

- Native support for extensions in the Cloud
- New test failure control with `execution.test.fail`
- Documentation for the stability guarantees

## New features

### Native support for extensions in the Cloud [#4670](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/4671)

The new Binary provisioning feature automatically requests and uses custom k6 binaries with the required extensions for your tests. This allows you to run scripts that use extensions without manually rebuilding k6 as it was in the past by depending on tools like `xk6`. The system caches binaries locally for efficiency, and any additional runs with the same dependencies will use the same binary and will run faster.

Binary provisioning is available for all k6 Cloud users (free and paid plans), and it's enabled by opt-in with the feature flag `K6_BINARY_PROVISIONING=true`.

Binary provisioning is a limited set of extensions that are supported, and it's not available for the `k6 run` command that might be added in the future. However, local development is supported with the `k6 cloud --local-execution` command if a cloud token is provided by the canonical login methods.

### Test failure control with `execution.test.fail` [#4672](https://github.com/grafana/k6/pull/4672)

The new `execution.test.fail` function allows you to explicitly fail a test while letting it continue execution until completion. This gives you more control over test outcomes while still collecting all metrics and completing necessary cleanup tasks.
